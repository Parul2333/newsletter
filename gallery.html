        <p><b>The court order comes hours after the Supreme Court granted Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convenor Arvind
                Kejriwal
                interim bail.</b><br>Delhi's Rouse Avenue court extended the judicial custody of chief minister Arvind
            Kejriwal
            until July 25 in a case registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against him in the excise
            policy case.

            The court order comes hours after the Supreme Court granted the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convenor an interim
            bail. Kejriwal, 55, was arrested by the CBI on June 26 while remaining in judicial custody in the ED case
            against him.

            The CBI has accused Kejriwal of being 'one of the main conspirators' in the irregularities linked to the
            now-scrapped Delhi excise policy. In the Delhi court, the agency had alleged that former media in-charge of
            AAP Vijay Nair, a close associate of Kejriwal, was in touch with various liquor manufacturers and trades and
            demanded undue gratification since March 2021, for incorporation of provisions favourable to them in the
            excise policy.

            In its previous chargesheet, the CBI had claimed that out of ₹100 crore kickbacks received by AAP, an amount
            of ₹44.45 crore was transferred to Goa during June 2021 to January 2022 via 'hawala channels', and was used
            for AAP's assembly poll campaign in the coastal state.</p>

        <p><b>Biden's twin gaffes at Nato event, Zelenskyy is 'Putin', Kamala Harris is 'Trump'</b>US President Joe
            Biden's saga of verbal slips continued as the 81-year-old first introduced Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy as
            his arch-enemy "Putin", before going on to mix up the names of his Vice President Kamala Harris and rival
            Donald TrumpThe 81-year-old Democrat initially began to walk offstage before realising his error and
            returning to correct himself. "Zelenskyy is gonna beat President Putin," he added.

            Zelenskyy appeared to take the misstep in stride, responding with a lighthearted comment. "I'm better," he
            said.

            Biden replied, "You're a hell of a lot better."

            At a so-called "big boy" solo press conference shortly afterwards, the US President fumbled his
            second-in-command Kamala Harris's name, referring to her as "Vice President Trump" while answering the first
            question fielded to him.

            "Look, I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president [if] I think she's not qualified to
            be president," Biden said, as top Democrats, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense
            Secretary Lloyd Austin looked on stony-faced.</p>

        <p><b>How Can State Block...": Supreme Court To Haryana On Shambhu Border Crossing</b><br>The Supreme Court has
            asked tough questions of the Haryana government after a High Court order this week directing the re-opening
            of the Shambhu border crossing, which has been locked down since February to block farmers protesting the
            centre's agricultural policies from marching on Delhi.
            "How can the state block a highway? It has a duty to regulate traffic... we are saying 'keep the border
            open, but also control it," the top court said Friday afternoon in oral observations on the matter.

            In a humorous but telling moment, the two-judge bench of Justice Surya Kant and Justice Ujjal Bhuyan asked
            the state's lawyer if he travelled by road, and specifically the highway."I think you travel by road..."
            Justice Kant asked, to which the lawyer replied, "Yes."

            "So you (too) must be facing trouble..." the judge shot back.

            The state had appealed a section of the Punjab and Haryana High Court's order, which directed a judicial
            inquiry into the death of farmer Shubhkaran Singh, 22. Mr Singh - one of thousands who had marched to
            Shambhu (on the Punjab-Haryana border) after talks broke down, and were met with fortifications of barbed
            wire, shipping containers, and cement barricades - was allegedly shot dead.</p>

        <p><b>Latest Flashpoint In Trinamool vs Bengal Governor: Rejected Bills</b><br> The West Bengal government has filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging Governor CV Ananda Bose's refusal to give assent to eight bills. The state's counsel, Astha Sharma, urged the court to list the petition for immediate consideration.
            The controversy arose after Governor's rejection of these bills without citing any reasons, prompting the Trinamool Congress-led government to argue that this action violates Article 200 of the Constitution. According to the state's submission, denying approval to bills without providing grounds undermines democratic governance.
            
            "The Governor's oversight poses a threat to democratic governance and infringes upon the rights of the state," argued the state's lawyer.</p>
